We understand that the temporary limits we placed on certain stocks from January 28 to February 4 were frustrating, especially since we built Robinhood to expand access to investing. We have always sought to put our customers first and we want you to be able to invest on your own terms. 

 
To help explain what happened and why we had to take action, we wrote [a letter to our customers.](https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/2/1/a-letter-to-our-robinhood-community) Here‚Äôs a summary of the letter:

* For Robinhood to operate, we must meet clearinghouse deposit requirements to support customer trades.
* Deposit requirements are determined in part by how much stock a firm‚Äôs customers hold. If a firm‚Äôs customers‚Äô holdings are volatile, a broker (in this instance Robinhood) is obligated to meet higher deposit requirements.
* Last week, in part due to [volatility](https://learn.robinhood.com/articles/the-stock-market-has-been-super-volatile-how-can-i-make-sense-of-it/) in some popular stocks, Robinhood‚Äôs deposit requirements rose tenfold. The combination of the deposit increase and the extraordinary increase in volume on these particular symbols led us to put temporary buying restrictions in place on a small number of those stocks. 
* We had to take steps to limit buying in those volatile stocks to ensure we could comfortably meet our deposit obligations. **We didn‚Äôt want to stop people from buying stocks and we certainly weren‚Äôt trying to help hedge funds.**

We stand with everyday investors participating in the market and we‚Äôll continue to improve as we break down barriers in the financial system.

TFC is 17.5x

USB is 15.5x

PNC is 9.5x

COF is 23x

Ignoring the outlier of WFC...our median is around 15.5x

If UBS gets priced at 15.5x we get an increase in share value from $15.40 to $28.  This is an 82% increase.  I think this will happen thru actions of UBS themselves because they‚Äôve initiated a 3yr stock buyback program, valued at $4.5 Billion and they plan to buyback $1.1 Billion in the first quarter.  The total buyback would reduce the amount of outstanding shares by around 300M.  Thus increasing the share price to around $18.33 at current price to earning.

However by reducing the amount of outstanding shares...it will significantly reduce dividend expense, and exponentially increase institutional value (while also lining the pockets of the execs including the new CEO - Ralph Hamers). Rumor is the new CEO was brought in to bring UBS into the digital future.

# **Stimulus prospects could boost the stock market and interest rates in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/12/stimulus-prospects-could-boost-the-stock-market-and-interest-rates-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; The prospects of a big government spending program could continue to boost the stock market and put upward pressure on interest rates in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; Earnings season is beginning to wind down, but some big names have yet to report.
*****
&gt; Walmart‚Äôs earnings on Thursday should provide a good window into the consumer, as should the government‚Äôs retail sales report for January, also expected Wednesday.
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve on Wednesday afternoon releases minutes from its last meeting, and investors will dig into those for any insight into the central bank‚Äôs view on inflation.
*****
&gt; # Two dominant themes amid stimulus prospects
&gt; Inflation and rising interest rates have been two dominant themes for investors recently and have become increasingly so as the market has upgraded its view of how much fiscal coronavirus stimulus could be signed into law.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe market is waiting to see how big the package is going to be. It‚Äôs going to be important. They can get it through reconciliation,‚Äù said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.
*****
&gt; Krosby said that Democrats could pass the stimulus under budget reconciliation, which means they could approve it with a simple majority instead of relying on negotiations with Republicans.
*****
&gt; Some in the markets had anticipated a package of $1 trillion or less if there was a negotiated deal, but that now looks unlikely. Strategists have changed their view on the proposed $1.9 trillion package.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThere is less pushback to President Biden‚Äôs proposed stimulus from moderate Democrats than we expected, so a price tag of around $1.5 trillion seems likely, which is higher than we initially thought,‚Äù noted Cornerstone Macro policy analysts.
*****
&gt; They say they expect a bill to come to the floor during the week of Feb. 22, and that it could become law by the first week of March. Investors will stay focused on its progress through Congress.
*****
&gt; Market pros expect the bigger the spending package, the larger the pop will be in economic growth in the near term. That has helped send Treasury yields, which move opposite price, to higher levels.
*****
&gt; It has also increased concerns about inflation.
*****
&gt; # Inflation and rising yields
In the past week, the 10-year yield ‚Äî a key benchmark ‚Äî touched 1.2% for the first time since March. It reached that level briefly early in the week but returned to it in the final hour of trading Friday.
*****
&gt; Yields are rising on optimism for an improving economy, but also as inflation expectations also move higher.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúIf you think about the big drivers, they‚Äôre related - vaccines, stimulus and inflation,‚Äù said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo Securities. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs more talk out of D.C. about moving the stimulus package forward, that sets the stage for yields to go up.‚Äù
*****
&gt; The market is concerned about the economy running hotter, since it could be a trigger to change Fed policy.
*****
&gt; At the same time, the Fed has said it would tolerate inflation above its 2% target.
*****
&gt; Krosby of Prudential Financial said the market will also pay attention to the producer price index Wednesday even though it is not typically a big factor.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúBecause there‚Äôs such a debate on inflationary trends, I know the CPI [consumer price index] came in comfortable, but the producer price index is coming in and we‚Äôll see if that has eased,‚Äù she said.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúObviously supply chains are being reestablished and inventories are building,‚Äù said Krosby.
*****
&gt; Consumer inflation was running at an annual pace of 1.4% in January.
*****
&gt; # Housing statistics
Housing data is also dominant on the calendar in the holiday-shortened week.
*****
&gt; The National Association of Home Builders releases its housing market index data on Wednesday, a measurement of sentiment around market conditions for new home sales.
*****
&gt; On Thursday, the government will issue data on pending home sales and building permits. Finally, the National Association of Realtors will release existing home sales data on Friday.
*****
&gt; Upcoming hearing on GameStop and short squeezes
Stocks were higher in the past week, with energy, tech and financials as the best performers. The S&amp;P 500 rose 1.2%, ending the week at 3,934.
*****
&gt; There were some market hot spots, like cannabis shares which became the latest target of the Reddit trading community. The stocks shot higher Wednesday, adding to already lofty gains in recent weeks before giving up some of those gains.
*****
&gt; Investors will also be focused on the Thursday hearing before the House Financial Services Committee on the wild trading recently in GameStop and other heavily-shorted names.
*****
&gt; Robinhood‚Äôs CEO is expected to testify, as are executives from Melvin Capital Management and Citadel.
*****
&gt; The frenzied activity in some small and shorted stocks has raised concerns about the market becoming overheated. But Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer, said the broader market‚Äôs advance is intact.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúOverall, it‚Äôs a bull market. I think the steadiness of the advance is underappreciated,‚Äù Wald said. He said the market technicals are healthy. Breadth is broad-based and there‚Äôs cyclical leadership.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe low-volatility, high-dividend paying sectors are at risk,‚Äù said Wald. Utilities and consumer staples stocks, which both fit that category, were lower on the week.
*****
&gt; The market was also awaiting the outcome of the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, and it is not expected to react.

&gt; # Presidents' Day Seasonality

&gt; The US equity market will be closed on Monday in observance of the Presidents' Day holiday. Since 1971 when the Uniform Monday Holiday Act set the third Monday in February, rather than on George Washington's birthday (February 22nd) as the Federal holiday, equity market performance during the week of Presidents' Day has been pretty mixed. From the Friday before President's Day through the Friday after, the S&amp;P 500 has traded higher half the time for an average decline of 5 bps. Taking a closer look, in the chart below we show the median returns by day for each trading day in Presidents' week. Tuesday and Thursday have both averaged declines of 13 bps and 7 bps, respectively. Wednesday averages flat performance but the S&amp;P 500 has only been higher 40% of the time. Despite weakness throughout most of the week, equities have tended to catch a bid by week's end with an average 6 bps gain on Friday with a move higher 58% of the time.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021221-Presidents-Day3f.png))**

&gt; In the charts below, we show the average intraday performance of the S&amp;P 500 during Presidents' Day week since 1983 when our intraday data begins. We also include looks for years when the S&amp;P 500 was up and down YTD headed into the holiday. Again, the general pattern has been a steady drift lower until Friday when the S&amp;P 500 has tended to rebound. We would note that the Friday rebound is not an all-day event. As shown, performance is pretty flat in the first several hours of trading with the biggest ramp higher occurring in the final of hours of tradings. That pattern is also consistent for both up and down years, though, in years that the S&amp;P 500 was down YTD headed into the holiday there was a bit of a rebound midweek which was reversed by the end of the week.

&gt; # Trading After Presidents‚Äô Day Weekend Continues to be Weak

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/902779bf6e4c3920c0a6e594303d1963/f9c2be89a4714ce6-96/s500x750/313ae18652b5c66a140a47602ee5649c59baeee7.jpg))**

&gt; In a recent post we looked at the improving trend of market performance ahead of Presidents‚Äô Day weekend. However, the two days after still display a fair amount of red. Since 1990, Tuesday after Presidents‚Äô Day has been strongest for the S&amp;P 500 with 18 gains and 13 losses for median gain of 0.12% but with an average loss of ‚Äì0.23%. DJIA also has more gains than losses on the Tuesday after, but NASDAQ is a net loser down 18 of 31 years with and average loss of ‚Äì0.49% and a median loss of ‚Äì0.11%.

&gt; Wednesday is all red for all three major averages. NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500 have more losses, but DJIA has a larger average loss. On the Wednesday after the Presidents‚Äô Day holiday DJIA is down 16 of 31 with an average loss of ‚Äì0.07% and a median decline of ‚Äì0.10%. S&amp;P 500 is down 18 of 31, average ‚Äì0.02%, median ‚Äì0.10% and NASDAQ is down 17 of 31, average ‚Äì0.01%, median ‚Äì0.09%.

&gt; # Why Bulls Will Like The Year Of The Ox

&gt; ‚ÄúBulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.‚Äù Old Wall Street saying.

&gt; The Chinese New Year (often called the Lunar New Year) will kick off Friday, February 12, and with it will begin the Year of the Ox. Although we would never suggest investing based on the zodiac signs‚Äîit is important to note that the Year of the Ox has historically been quite strong for equities. Not to mention we are saying goodbye to the year of the Rat. Good riddance to the Rat, as the last two years of the Rat were 2008 and 2020, not the best years for many reasons!

&gt; Since the Chinese New Year typically starts between late-January and mid-February, we looked at the 12-month return of the S&amp;P 500 Index starting at the end of January dating back to 1950. And wouldn‚Äôt you know it? The Year of the Ox has been up more than 13% on average (with a median advance of nearly 18%); suggesting bulls are smiling indeed!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.10.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; ‚ÄúThe year of the Ox is the second of the 12 animal signs of the Chinese zodiac, and the Ox is considered a symbol of diligence, persistence, and honesty. Equity returns indeed are quite persistent during the Ox, as it is the third best return out of the 12 Zodiac signs,‚Äù explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; The LPL Chart of the Day shows how all the 12 Zodiac signs have done historically, with the Goat, Tiger, and Ox as the best, while the Rooster and Snake have been the worst.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.10.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; We want to stress that no one should invest purely based on the zodiac signs. This relationship is random and the sample size is small. Still, here‚Äôs hoping that the Year of the Ox plays out well for the bulls once again!

&gt; # Short Interest Update

&gt; Yesterday, bi-weekly short interest data was released for the period ending January 30th. In the chart below, we show the Russell 3000 broken up into deciles based on short interest as a percent of the float at the end of 2020 and these decile's stock's median change in short interest from then to yesterday's release. As shown, with the short squeeze episode playing out in the second half of January, the stocks that came into 2020 the most heavily shorted have seen the biggest declines in short interest. That decile of what had been the most heavily shorted names has seen short interest as a percent of float fall for a median of 2.65 percentage points. Deciles two and three have similarly seen sizable declines, though, they are far smaller than those of the most shorted stocks. On the other hand, the decile of the least shorted stocks is the only one that has seen the median short interest reading move higher since the end of 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Deciles-F.png))**

&gt; In the table below, we show the stocks that currently have the highest short interest as a percent of float. After the historic move higher, short squeeze poster child GameStop (GME) is no longer the Russell 3000's most heavily shorted name! Having dropped over 100 percentage points since the start of the year, only 42.61% of shares are now short compared to 43.57% for Gogo (GOGO); currently the most shorted stock in the index. GOGO has actually seen its shorts come off a bit this year as well but that decline has been far more modest of only a little more than one percentage point. Of the other stocks in the index, only Tanger Outlets (SKT) and Dillard's (DDS) also currently have more than 40% of the float sold short.

&gt; On the January 27th closing high, GME was up 1,744.53% year to date. But with the short squeeze unwinding, the stock has fallen over 86%. Others of this cohort have similarly seen big reversals of their earlier surges. For example, National Beverage (FIZZ) had doubled YTD at the time of the GME peak, but since then it has been cut by 33.78%. Not all of these have been losers since the pinnacle of short selling though. Fulgent Genetics, have similarly seen big gains of over 30%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Current-High.png))**

&gt; Given GME came into the year with an absurd number of shares sold short, the squeeze has resulted in it being the biggest decliner in terms of short interest of any Russell 3000 stock. Short interest as a percentage of float has fallen over 100 percentage points YTD. The next biggest drop came from BigCommerce Holdings (BIGC) and Dillard's (DDS) which both saw larger than 50 percentage point drops. Of the rest of the top twenty biggest decliners, a baker's dozen have seen short interest drop by at least 20 points. Additionally, of these stocks that have seen short interest fall the most, only three‚ÄînCino (NCNO), Berkeley Lights (BLI), and 3D Systems (DDD)‚Äînow have a single-digit short interest as a percent of float.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Decline.png))**

&gt; Given the massive short squeezes, there are far more stocks that now have a lower short interest as a percent of float than at the start of the year. In fact, of the Russell 3000 stocks, 1887 have seen declines in short interest compared to only 1146 that have seen an increase. In the table below, we show the twenty stocks to have seen the biggest increases in SIPF since the start of the year. As shown, there is only one, International Game Technology (IGT), that has seen short interest rise by double digits since the end of 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Increase.png))**

&gt; Retailers notably dominate the list of stocks with the biggest declines in short interest. To quantify this, in the chart below we show the aggregate number of shorted shares as a percent of total float for each industry group as of the most recent short interest data and the end of 2020. As shown, just as it was at the start of the year, retailers remain the most heavily shorted industry group, but it has greatly improved with only 5.86% short compared to 8.15% at the end of 2020. That is the only industry group to have seen short interest drop by a full percentage point or more. The industry group to have experienced the next largest decline was Transportation with aggregate short interest falling from 5.08% to 4.13%. Conversely, there are two industries, Banks and Materials, that have higher short interest as a percent of float than they did at the end of 2020.

Even a retard like me know how fucking stupid the reason is. Let's see, you buy a stock, other people start buying, the interest on the short position goes up, the short investor needs to cover his position, and he is desperate to pay any price because he is so heavily reverse-invested in the stock. That's the gist of a short squeeze retards.

If you are buying a no-name stock, you don't know the ratio of short against the outstanding stock and a ton of other factors you don't have an idea how to google, you don't get to squeeze the short investor. The short investor will just see a temporary bump and that's all. DFV is a professional finance guy with a CFA and with the appropriate of autism to make him successful, you are investing based on the word ""short squeeze"" and just downloaded Robinhood last week and the only dime you made from that when someone clicked on the referral link you posted on facebook.

Your main goal is to find a heavily shorted stock first and somehow keep raising its price. But that requires quite some effort, charisma and retard luck to do that. And let's not forget nobody here knows why the heck the stock price actually rises, yet we assume the SEC, the stock exchange and every in the Wallstreet is corrupt! But somehow posting emojis will raise the price.

I have put the obligatory emojis so that retarded analyst using the reddit API can find this post and try to make sense using efficient market hypothesis, black and Scholes or whatever the fuck they learned in business school because they weren't smart enough to become an engineer.

# What is LoanDepot?

Loan Depot is the second largest nonbank Mortgage Originator in the united states. Having gone public in just the last few days. It's taken a similar approach that other mortgage originator IPOs have gone in the last few years, [a severely underpriced IPO](https://www.housingwire.com/articles/loandepot-raises-just-54m-in-downsized-ipo/) LDi isnt too far behind Rocket Mortgage, arguably the #1 in the space right now. LDI has a 3 billion dollar market cap, **compared to Rocket's 40 billion dollar market cap.** Even though LDI is more storefront focused and RKT is dominant with their online presence and super bowl ads, if these companies are even in the same universe, **there is still massive upside for LDI.** Sure, we have to take into consideration that Rocket absolutely dumped right after it's IPO after an initial pop, but the company was already fully valued. LDI is not. I'm setting a $100 price target after a few months. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Another interesting catalyst

&amp;#x200B;

Loan depot is about to have an earnings call on the [18th of this month](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/loandepot-inc-report-fourth-quarter-130000039.html). It's my understanding that they don't even need to do this as they have just gone public. This could be a huge announcement, or some forward looking statements/guidance that they are releasing to burn the underwriters who severely underpriced their company and left them with just 54 million in cash after years of trying to go public. Mortgage originations are at multi year highs, and interest rates are dirt cheap, so im not thinking that this is a multi-year growth stock, however a hold for a few months might have a huge payoff. In the end, make your own decision but I really think this one is a no brainer. What do you guys think?

**What is Cloudflare?**

Cloudflare is going to make a leading player in next-generation computing. From their blog: [https://blog.cloudflare.com/rendering-react-on-the-edge-with-flareact-and-cloudflare-workers/](https://blog.cloudflare.com/rendering-react-on-the-edge-with-flareact-and-cloudflare-workers/). Excerpt:

&gt;‚ÄúImagine you‚Äôre the maintainer of a high-traffic media website, and your DNS is already hosted on Cloudflare.  
Page speed is critical. You need to get content to your audience as quickly as possible on every device. You also need to render ads in a speedy way to maintain a good user experience and make money to support your journalism...¬†¬†you‚Äôre going to need to pay for some beefy servers to be able to handle spikes in traffic and respond to requests in a timely manner...Cloudflare Workers allow you to run your code on the edge quickly, efficiently and at scale. Instead of paying for a server to host your code, you can host it directly inside the datacenter‚Äù

Seriously, this is cool, and it‚Äôs only beginning. Cloudflare is innovating every day. Their customers absolutely love them. As a software engineer, they have already have some products are there that are pretty cool like Cloudflare Pages and Cloudflare Workers. I think what‚Äôs going to help them into a powerhouse is this:

&gt;Over the coming months, we‚Äôll be working on integrating Workers and Pages into a seamless experience. It‚Äôll work the exact same way Pages does: just write your code, git push, and we‚Äôll deploy it for you. The only difference is, it won‚Äôt just be your frontend, it‚Äôll be your backend, too. And just to be clear: this is not just for stateless functions. With Workers KV and Durable Objects, we see a huge opportunity to really enable any web application to be built on this platform.

Soon, developers will be able to make full-stack applications end-to-end using Cloudflare‚Äôs network. Cloudflare will handle all of the annoying stuff about development including hosting and deployment. And they‚Äôll allow developers of all size to instantly scale their application across the entire United States, all while increasing developer productivity and satisfaction.

If you‚Äôre not a developer, you probably didn‚Äôt understand most of that, but essentially, they‚Äôre making it so you can build entire applications using solely their infrastructure. This is actually genuinely cool, and will save the average developer tons of time and money.

I can easily see how this propels their growth even faster than 50%. And if this thing inches up to 60-65% YoY as it expands it‚Äôs profitability... üöÄüöÄüöÄ

(And even if it doesn‚Äôt, and stays at 50%, it will still üöÄ but slower. Regardless, it‚Äôs going up)

\---

‚ÄúBuT iT tAnKeD oN EaRnInGs‚Äù

That drop is an absolute blessing to those who aren‚Äôt long. Plus it‚Äôs hardly a tank when it‚Äôs at ATHs if you exclude the one week in its history where it was higher

Its earnings was good, and to those who haven‚Äôt read it, [do so](https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2021/cloudflare-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2020-financial-results/) besides relying on a stock‚Äôs immediate reaction. To the 90% who will completely ignore that sentence:

&gt;Revenue growth was 50% YOY which is consistent with the last 3 earnings

Revenue right now is $125 million. Doesn‚Äôt sound like much at first, but those of us know the power of compound interest knows how fast that number will be pumped. 5 years from now, that‚Äôs $1 billion a year. In 8 it will be $3 billion

Yes, 5-8 years is a long time. This is a buy and hold stock. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm long Jan 21 115c.

The revenue and growth isn‚Äôt the impressive part. The margins are

&gt;GAAP gross profit was $96.9 million, or 76.9% gross margin, compared to $65.7 million, or 78.3%, in the fourth quarter of 2019.

High 70s margins is absolutely incredible. And it's consistent quarter to quarter. That means once NET does reach profitability, they‚Äôre going to be **raking** in dough

That being said, NET isn‚Äôt profitable yet, which is pretty much the only argument bears can muster (that and high valuation but more on that later). Keep in mind they‚Äôve been screeching the same thing since 2019 and that hasn‚Äôt stopped it. But once profitability is out of the way, there‚Äôs nothing stopping it from being a $300 stock. Here‚Äôs why:

\- Like I mentioned earlier, their losses are decreasing and if my hypothesis is correct, they will reach profitability by early ‚Äò22

\- Currently 15% of the internet goes through Cloudflare‚Äôs network and that number is increasing. Literally, 1/6th of the entire internet infrastructure is worth $25 billion. In comparison, a bike company (PTON) is worth double that.

\- Boomer companies who need to replace their shitty infrastructure will likely turn to Cloudflare due to their reliable secure networks with guaranteed security. Not to mention their prices are dirt-cheap compared to their competitors.

‚Äî-

**CONS**

The only cons are people concerned with profitability (covered already) and evaluation (priced at 60x sales which tbf is absolutely outrageous). However I think this is still short-sighted. As long as the bull market remains intact (big IF, but I‚Äôm a bull so as long interest rates are 0), there‚Äôs no reason to believe the rocket rally will end. As we see with SHOP and TSLA, traditional valuations don‚Äôt matter if the product has a dream, vision, and story, which with Cloudflare‚Äôs ‚ÄúBuild a Better Internet‚Äù shtick, I think it does. Especially because customers actually like their product and Cloudflare will continue to innovate and build upon Cloudflare‚Äôs already enormous Cloudflare network.

This stock already got [multiple](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/cloudflare-drops-despite-multiple-price-target-upgrades) analysts upgrades. The drop was a blessing to those who aren‚Äôt in. Start investing in quality and innovation; $85/share is a whole lot less than $300 which is where they will be by 2025 (I want to say 2022, but I‚Äôm trying to be conservative here).

Seriously, give this a second look. I‚Äôve been playing NET since 37. It‚Äôs a shit stock that consolidates for months, then rockets 30% in a week. Earnings being great (and not excellent) is the only reason NET hasn‚Äôt done its 30% move.

**What is COTY?** Coty is the makeup/cosmetics king. With its subsidiaries, it develops, manufactures, markets, and distributes fragrances, cosmetics, skin care, nail care, and both professional and retail hair care products. Coty owns around 77 brands as of 2018. These brands include: Covergirl, Burberry, Gucci, Calvin Klein, Boss, Chloe ETC. You can google the rest if you are curious.

**Why are they beaten down?** One major reason: With the pandemic, a lot of girls have adopted work from home/stay home lifestyles. Basically, alot of girls are too lazy and don't find the necessity to put on any makeup or perfume if they are just sitting at home with their sweatpants on. 

**Recovery/Online Growth**: Makeup/skincare isn't going anywhere, this isn't a dying industry. Also this has jump started COTY's e-commerce sales though their retail sales were hurting. According to their recent 4Q earnings call they are reporting that their percentage of net revenue through e-commerce has DOUBLED from pre-covid. As they invest in their e-commerce and online sales partnerships I can see this growing into a cosmetics/skincare version of Chewy. 

**Asian Expansion**: They are investing heavily in the Asian market and are seeing huge revenue gains from their previous investment. China is a huge market for cosmetics, especially premium skincare brands. Trust me, from dating alot of asian girls, they use makeup and skincare like its CRACK. They are addicted to the stuff. According to the CEO they have seen a whopping 40% Year Over Year increase in their prestige brand skincare retail sales in China. Considering again the lockdown environment this would probably be magnitudes higher if it were a non-pandemic year. Another sign of huge potential in Asia, is their Gucci skincare brand partnership with a Chinese Influencer had over 100million digital convos, the amount of skincare addicts in asia is insane and COTY will be making bank.

**New Leadership** - Sue Nabi new CEO, appointed July 2020, is a growth innovator in the beuty industry. Before joining COTY she oversaw double digit growth 4 years in a row in both Loreal Paris and Lancome. She also launched a booming green new-age skincare brand back in 2014. She is exactly what COTY needs, a younger smarter visionary CEO with the guts and experience to turn this retail focused blob into a online growth juggernaut.

**Price predictions**: I believe by eoy COTY will be back to 15 just as a recovery play. As they further expand their asian and online presense I could see them getting valued more as a growth play over the next 2 years. Growth price target: 50+

Welcome my retards and Yolo artists,

As many of you know, blizzcon 2021 is coming and here a few prediction from my side:

Wow, the biggest IP of Activision Blizzard will get a new major content patch in April-June, making people re subscribe to experience the content.

Diablo 4 will get a release date with pre ordering enabled surging in sweet millions. 

Overwatch 2 will be released this year so more millions for them. 

Hearthstone will get a new battle pass in the next few months so again a few bucks more. 


Q: Activision Blizzard has a 80B market cap, will D4 even rise it high? 
A: probably yes. If we look at the Release of shadow lands and many people returning to wow buying a monthly subscription and the expansion for ~60$ has increased the price of the stock from 80$ to something above 90$ now blizzcon pre-orders had pushed it to 100$/share. Diablo 4 might at least push the worth of the stock by 10$ because I assume 90% of the wow fanbase are also Diablo fans. 

All in all I think investing in Activision-Blizzard is a no brainer at the given time. Since the release of classic Wow servers and shadowlands they have been slowly but steady regaining worth and if they won't fuck up during an esports event a la Blitzchung, it is pretty safe to assume the stonks will go up to at least 120$/stonk.

0.0,liyay9,84.0,"With the pandemic still going on and everyone needing more computers than ever and the ongoing trade war with China, there is a severe Chip shortage.

On Thursday, the CEOs of the major Chip producers (Intel, AMD, QCOM) have sent a letter to Biden that he should sent out an executive order to adress this shortage. ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage))

I see three different scenarios:

1. Biden gives an executive order to build improve and increase the domestic chip foundries. This would be most bullish for Intel, since they are the only company with foundries in the USA. This would also help AMD and QCOM, since they would most likely that access to cheaper chips.
2. Biden lifts the trade restrictions set on semiconductors. This would mean that AMD and QCOM would get access to cheaper chips, but it would not solve the shortage of silicon so it is unlikely to happen. This would be bullish for AMD and Qualcomm, but it would not change the situation for Intel.
3. Biden does not do anything and the shortage will continue. If Biden does this nothing will be changed, it will be neither good or bad from Intel and AMD. AMD will still keep growing at a massive rate and Intel will still be a cash cow.

So regardless of what happens, I am very bullish on the semiconductor industry. I expect Biden to start ramping up semiconductor manufacturing the USA, because of his tough stance on China. At the moment almost all of the semiconductor industry is relying on Taiwan, and with the Chinese involvement in that country, it is very likely that their is bipartisan support for increasing semiconductor manufacturing domestically.

all you autists looking ""for the next GME"". well guess what, there is no next GME. that milk's spilt, sour and cold. but there's a company out there so boring, so \*\*\*\*ing uninteresting, that just like GME is has strong value characteristics, and has over 100% short float, and it's hiding in plain sight.

**UWMC**: stands for United Whole Mortgage C\*nts. they do things with mortgages. right now, the market doesn't really like things to do with mortgages, because its a cyclical business nearing its peak. it's pumping out great returns (maybe at this peak) and valued at only 5.5x P/E. the market don't care. Last earnings, the company reported EBITDA of $1.4B FOR THE QUARTER (whole market cap of only $15B). It also has a big boomer 4.5% dividend. This sh\*t is unloved just like your dross GME was, and like GME is actually a fly guy of a bizniz

**The set-up**: this was a former SPAC. I know, I know. Some of you apes held this when it was a SPAC, and now your diapers are in a twist because it didn't moon. Well, f\*\*\* off I don't care. You're not the only ones: HFs are short this guy like you wouldn't believe. THE FLOAT IS ONLY 6% OF THE ENTIRE MARKET CAP, and half of it is like by one institution that's in it for the long-term (Magnetar). That means the effective float is only 3%! Right now it's being manipulated like you wouldn't believe. This thing is a powder keg and it can explode in the shorts' face.

**The mooning**: There are huge numbers of calls at $15 and $17.5. If this thing gets anywhere close to them in a short period of time, the gamma squeeze could propel this thing to $50-60 in a week. If it doesn't. If it doesn't, you're holding an actual good clucking company at 5.5x PE, so you're brains wont be over your windshield like you late weed apes. Fundamentally it's probably worth $20-25, so you have an actual fundamental value play here too just as a back-up

**The play**: buy shares first! This thing has a squoze in it. Also buy 2/19 and 3/19 calls at $10-17.5

**DD link for short report**: [https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/UWMC](https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/UWMC)

**TLDR**: everyone hated GME. now every hates UWMC. UWMC is boring and doesn't get you high so you apes have missed it, but it has effective 100% short interest for tiny float (3%) of company, strong fundamentals and a squeeze that hasn't squoze, company worth double anyway but could easily run up 10x if the shorts get nuk'd

**Me**: in for 4,000 shares at $9.18. this is not financial advice. do your own diligence you cucks.

AMD has been in a recent downtrend since the start of january. However, the price action is starting to consolidate around 92 with a small run thats gonna run out of steam soon. 

The MACD just crossed at the -0.2 so the reversal may be weak. The Stoch also is more than halfway to oversold territory. Once it runs out of steam it may have its current 93 price as a support, if not the next support is at 89 ish

This means a little sideways action with the 95 resistance before retesting ATH. Now, i could be wrong, but i do not foresee any catalysts in the next weeks (feel free to chime in).

   According to this Zack's article: [here](https://finance.zacks.com/average-return-dow-jones-during-its-lifetime-3314.html)

   In the 91 years prior to 1987 the Dow Jones Industrial Average grew at an average rate of 4.3%. Overall rate over its 122 years in 5.42%, in a 25 year sample from 1987-2012 the DJ grew by 7.55%. What the fuck? Why almost double since 1987? In my personal opinion the early adoption of the personal computer by Wallstreet and the emergence of fast growth tech companies that the semiconductor gave birth to. In summary I've elected to use 7.55% for my calculations because we don't use the Pony Express or Wells Fargo to deliver stock certificates anymore(Buffett might still use WF lol).

   I'm going 20 years back here for a proper trend line, and it will segue into another related analysis for the second half. Starting in Y2K, thats the year 2000 for you Gen Zs, the DJIA was 10,729.38. Now let's use that 7.55% average year over growth and forecast the Dow today vs one with no housing collapse. 

DJ Current: 31,458.40

DJ No 2008: 49,746.08

   The fallout from the events in 2008 set the market trend line behind by 6 and a half years on the 7.55% model. My actual analysis of the 20 year sample I used finds a 6.54%, but that includes a -33.84% drop for '08. If you remove that event the growth rockets to 8.54%. So I feel like the 7.55% model is perfectly reasonable.

   In summation analysts(üåàüêª) have been screeching for the last half decade about how we are do for a market correction, and I agree! The market is attempting to correct losing a third of its value that took a century to build in one year!

This campaign has been largely led by large hedge funds. Without S&amp;P inclusion, the story might have ended there with hedge funds trying to escape with their profits and leaving retail the bag. However, S&amp;P inclusion presented these hedge funds with a much better option to close out their positions while also riding the stock down. The shares that hedge funds no longer wanted began to be picked up by passive funds leading to selloffs by the active funds which pushed prices to this level.

No retail trader is buying 1m+ in deep OTM puts, this is an attempt by hedgies to push the price down.

We can also see this from the massive shift in options volume. $190B of calls open interest and over $250B of puts open interest, a massive put skew. This is especially significant because ""To put it in context it is equal to the combined $AAPL and $AMZN bullish skew or if you‚Äôd rather to the combined  $BABA, $FB, $MSFT, $GOOG and $WMT combined."" reflecting extremely bearish sentiment in an very very bullish market.

Once the reversal begins there will be nothing stopping it as OTM puts get less and less OTM. There are no shorts left to be squeezed and the bag holding passive funds which are largely barred from holding derivatives will have no way of rebalancing the options skew.

**Company profile:**  
  
Cerence builds **AI powered virtual assistants** for the mobility/transportation market   including but not limited to two-wheel vehicles, planes, tractors, cruise ships and elevators.  
  
Our solutions power natural conversational and intuitive interactions between vehicles, drivers and passengers, and the broader digital world. We are a **premier provider** of AI- powered assistants and innovations for connected and autonomous vehicles, including one of the world‚Äôs most popular software platforms for building automotive virtual assistants, such as ‚ÄúHey BMW‚Äù and ‚ÄúNi hao Banma‚Äù. 
  
**Market Capitalization:**  
  
Cerence has a market cap of just **$5 billion**. As a play on two of the hottest growth segments (EV and AI), Cerence has and likely will continue to see prolific growth.   
  
**Customer Profile:**  
  
**CERENCE products are in 53% OF ALL NEW CARS SHIPPED in 2020. This equates to 38 MILLION cars alone in 2020 and 325 million vehicles to date.**   
    
Customers include all major automobile original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, or their tier 1 suppliers worldwide, including BMW, Daimler, FCA Group, Ford, Geely, GM, Renault-Nissan, SAIC, Toyota, Volkswagen Group, Aptiv, Bosch, Continental, DENSO TEN and Harman. We deliver our solutions on a white-label basis, enabling our customers to deliver customized virtual assistants with unique, branded personalities and ultimately strengthening the bond between their brands and end users. Our vision is to enable a more enjoyable, safer journey for everyone.   
    
**Competitive Strengths: ** (directly from 10K)  
  
**Industry-leading speech-related technology**  
    
**Hybrid edge-cloud system architecture** Our software platform‚Äôs hybrid architecture combines the performance, reliability and tight integration that only edge software can provide with the flexibility of cloud connectivity.   
  
**Bespoke vehicle integration and acoustic tuning** Cognitive assistance for categories such as navigation, entertainment and control require tight integration with onboard vehicle components, which vary widely among vehicle models. Separately, speech interaction systems can be significantly hampered by the noisy environment of a vehicle cabin and must be tuned for particular acoustics and audio system components. To achieve the tight vehicle integration necessary to address these concerns, our professional services team works closely with OEMs and suppliers to customize our offerings for the particular characteristics of specific vehicle models.   
  
**Broad language coverage** Our software platform supports over 70 languages and dialects, far more than any of our competitors. As a result of our broad language support, our customers are already delivering cognitive assistance based on our software platform in over 60 countries across the Americas, Europe and Asia, including China, the U.S. and all other large automotive markets. Our language support also enables multi-lingual capabilities for domains such as music selection, point-of-interest selection, and cross-border navigation among others, representing a critical feature for markets such as Continental Europe in which automobiles may routinely traverse multiple lingual zones. We believe that our portfolio of languages and multi-lingual capabilities represent an important competitive advantage, as the development of capabilities to support a new language is expensive and time-consuming.   
  
**Broad, global network of deep relationships with OEMs and tier 1 suppliers** We have supplied speech recognition systems to OEMs and suppliers for over 20 years, working closely with our customers through our global professional services organization to design and integrate our solutions into their brands.   
  
**Competitors:** A real DD always addresses the competitive landscape. 
  
**Large technology companies** Many large technology companies, including Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent, offer Internet-based virtual assistants. Given the popularity in general of these virtual assistants, we believe that automobile drivers and riders increasingly desire the ability to use them as part of the mobility experience.   
   
**Small, focused competitors** We compete for business directly with certain companies focused on voice-based virtual assistance, including SoundHound in the U.S., iFlyTek in China, and other regional and technology-focused competitors. These companies have had some success selling into our customer base. However, we believe that we have multiple meaningful competitive advantages, including our scale, our globally distributed team, our best-in-class portfolio of compatible languages, and our deep focus on the automotive market. We also believe that our technology, particularly our speech signal enhancement and acoustic tuning, is superior based on benchmarking results against our competitors. We believe we will continue to be able to compete successfully against these competitors as we continue to invest in our offerings.   
  
**Competitors (My analysis):**  
   
I appreciate that Cerence's auditors make sure they address all potential risks. However, I do not see big tech as a threat. I see them as a ""gain-guarantee."" Cerence's AI is years ahead of the big players and Cerence‚Äôs small peers. The biggest risk I see here is that a company--ahem like AAPL or Google--might purchase Cerence. Cerence's market cap makes it a likely candidate of a buyout in the future.    
  
**Revenues:**   
  
Revenues are up to $326 Million for fiscal year 2020. **$95 Million in Q1 2021** literally on pace for 25% revenue growth. [Here‚Äôs a chart with Revenue growth for the last three years]( https://imgur.com/a/eNKnHnR)    
  
**Gross Margin:**   

72% gross margin in the most recent fiscal quarter. Huge margins which is extremely attractive.  

**Research and Development:**  
   
The best expense on the income statement in my opinion. Cerence has had negative net incomes in the past few fiscal years due primarily to R&amp;D costs. This maintains and expands their already vast competitive advantage.   
  
‚ÄúWe believe that continued investment in research and development will be critical for us to continue to deliver market-leading solutions for automotive cognitive assistance. Accordingly, we intend to continue to invest in our product portfolio and allocate capital and resources to our growth opportunities.‚Äù  

**Balance Sheet:**  
  
$1,700,000,000 assets to $700,000,000 liabilities. For my finance guys, a 1.37 current ratio. $266 bil in LTD.      
    
Goodwill is a concentrated risk that makes up most of their assets (over $1 billion). Definitely not the best.   

**Cash flows:**  
  
Cash flow from op positive.   
   
**Why this is the best play out on the market right now:**.

*Market leader

*Undervalued as fuck

Sun, the 30 year-old entrepreneur who bought $10 million worth of GameStop Corp. at the height of its Reddit-fueled rally, is predicting a paradigm shift in investing as younger people swarm into financial assets.

Sun said he‚Äôs prepared to hold onto his GameStop shares that he purchased near the highs late last month üíéüñê in an effort to tap into the adrenaline-charged rush that lured retail investors into so-called meme stocks. He also bought $1 million in AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and a further $1 million in silver. The GameStop position is now worth just $2 million, Sun said.

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm going to hold. Even if I lose money on the GME stock, I still believe this is a paradigm shift,‚Äù Sun said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. ‚ÄúIn the past we all followed the advice from the financial analysts, and these days people are going to make their own decisions.‚Äù

Why might this be you ask? The answer is simple. Lets look at what tendencies **Paper Portnoys** exhibit that is counter-productive to the survival of meme stonks:

A) Buy high and sell low to ""mitigate"" losses. This was the **OG Paper Portnoy** who lost 700K on Gee-Emm-Eee when holding wouldve cost him 0$.

First, Dan Gilbert and Warren Buffet are friends. This we know.

Second, according to the IPO, RHI (AKA Dan Gilbert) via the Class D shares retains 79% of the voting power, but currently has 94.2% of the economic interest based on his holdings of 94.2% of the total stock. It's therefore likely out of any deals he wishes to retain that 79% interest in the stock/voting(this becomes important later).

Third, between Berkshire's 13f filing on 11/16 (with a portion submitted separately as confidential), it was widely reported Buffet had plans for a ""secret"" investment, but how much and in what company?

The how much we know, the difference between their 13f and 10q filings (minus some foreign investments) is approximately $9 billion. Then there is the what? We do know his largest reductions were in bank stocks(the biggest reduction being in Wells Fargo), but does buffet really want to move away from finance or maybe he just wants to reposition in finance away from traditional banks.

If it's the latter, $RKT makes sense, but how do you buy $9 billion of a $40 billion company without anyone knowing? Timing....

$RKT reports on the 25th after various organizations have to report on the 16th (15th is a financial holiday). Over a 5% stake has to be reported within 10 days. RHI reported it's holdings early in the month. If RHI wants to they can convert 15.2%(94.2% - 79%) equivalent of the total outstanding stock from Class D to Class A in a private equity sale(AKA Black Book) so as not to directly affect the stock price, not report it for up to 10 days, and keep their 79% vote share/Economic interest. Then Berkshire can report their 13f and a bit later file their 10q on the purchase. With $RKT reporting the ""big partnership"" just before ER to maxmize momentum going in to it. 

Relationships, nummbers, dates for filing and chosen, all lead me to believe $RKT is the secret Buffet investment and plans to acquire about 25% of the company. This also means with four profitable quarters(the fourth being announce on the 25th) $RKT would also be eligible for S&amp;P inclusion(due to the float increase) adding further value to the acquisition. All that plus the high short interest scrambling to get out(and Buffet followers scrambling to get in) and $RKT could soon be a multi-bagger in short order.

Note: 9 billion was likely based on the original $27 for 150 mil share original prospectus, but likely the deal changed after $RKT hasn't performed as well and likely the $1 billion buyback was announced to help that performance(Buffet thinks buybacks should be used for price support by companies so it follows his theory on their use).

Edit: I'd watch to see if the 13f still shows confidential as the lock-up didn't end until 02/02 and the transaction would likely be scheduled for the 16th so it doesn't need to be reported for 10 days, aka the 26th which just happens to be the day after RKT's ER call. Also, no other company has reported 5%+ new economic ownership by Berkshire since their Nov. 16th 13f.

Edit 2: It also makes sense from a non-investment business perspective. It would provide synchronicity with other Buffet holdings. It would help with Gieco(mortgage customers to Geico and Geico customers to RKT), Berkadia(multi-family/commercial lending which RKT doesn't handle), Berkshire Hathaway Automotive(sells cars, but doesn't handle direct financing, but RKT Auto does), Cavalier and Clayton homes(new homes which can be passed to RKT to increase sales there), and finally Home Services(realtor group).

Don‚Äôt worry guys, there is GREAT advice from Yahoo! Finance for all of you paper hand apes out there. 

Are you down thousands of dollars on GME, AMC, BB, or other meme stocks you got from WSB*? ALL you have to do is just cut your losses so that you can get tax-loss benefits and offset your gains. That‚Äôs it. Just sell at a loss. 

Of course, those stocks will tank even more and all the Institutional Investors who shorted them will probably get exactly what they want, but hey! At least you got some tax benefit. 


This post is 100% pure unadulterated sarcasm, but on the reals... if you need the money, hate the stock, or have Paper Hand Syndrome, sell your stock.

0.0,liqvpq,969.0,"The only reason GME is where it is right now is through blatant market manipulation. 

On January 28th GME was over $500 pre market. It had sensational momentum. Buying GME on the 27th at $300+ was not a bad play. GME had already gravity slingshotted round Earth and had blown past the moon, on course to leave the fucking Milky Way. The shorts were completely fucking fucked. They were done. Dead. Bags heavier than a dying star. About to be squeezed so hard they‚Äôd turn into hand shaped diamonds. And then suddenly they weren‚Äôt. 

It wasn‚Äôt fucking short laddering that saved them. It wasn‚Äôt fucking ‚Äúhedge fund tactics.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt synthetic longs. It wasn‚Äôt a bear raid (look it up, this is what they are actually doing ). It wasn‚Äôt cause gme was a silly meme play. none of this is what stopped the inter dimensional GME rocket. 
 
What saved them? Market manipulation. ‚ÄúThey‚Äù (dtc/ brokers / clearing houses whoever) changed the rules and essentially banned buying the stock.  They locked the (retail at least) market out of one side of a trade. The fuck?

They didn‚Äôt halt the stock. 


They didn‚Äôt suspend it. 


The stock wasn‚Äôt halted by the exchanges. No That would stop all trading. 


They just stopped people *buying*. Kill the demand and surprise! supply overtakes demand  and price drops like your wife‚Äôs pants when her bf is in town. 

But why?

If they hadn‚Äôt restricted buying? Well the shorts would be bankrupt. But they can‚Äôt let retail win. Specially fucking Reddit. Retail investors are idiots remember. Institutions are far smarter than that bunch. 

The big boys can‚Äôt have retail win. That‚Äôs preposterous. So just stop em buying. You do that to *any stock* and it would absolutely tank. Its mind blowing how blatant it was. 

And this was all to get themselves out a terrible situation they engineered through sheer unadulterated greed. So greedy that dumbfuck retail caught them with their dick in the cookie jar. So bad that  the clearing houses / dtc didn‚Äôt want to pay for the gargantuan bags that were being held by the shorts. Because they‚Äôd have to. Someone had to pay and the shorts were, well, poetically the shorts were going to be short... A few billion dollars. 

So it turns out all you have to do to avoid being molested by the squeeze of the century is change the rules, very clearly manipulate the stocks price, and suddenly squeezeageddon is a little gentle hug.

If this doesn‚Äôt show just how rigged the markets are, I don‚Äôt know what else could. Maybe a news story coming out that the DTC and large firms have a daily morning zoom call to literally decide what every single stocks opening and closing price will be every day, and then phone Cramer so he can say the opposite on CNBC. 

Everything else since the great buying lockdown is small fry fuckery. Remember this.

But here‚Äôs the other thing. You think the boys at the funds hoarding short positions like they‚Äôre some kind of short dragon of Wall Street  are going just go ‚Äúwell that was close, let‚Äôs close all our GME shorts now while we can?‚Äù No fucking way. I guaranfuckingtee they‚Äôre doubling down. They think GME is worth $0. They aren‚Äôt to stop until they‚Äôre right.

From his wiki

 ‚ÄúChen became CEO of Sybase in 1998.[12] As Sybase had been a strong competitor of Oracle, but had become a ""dead company"" after failing to enter the market for enterprise applications, as Oracle had. 
Chen and his team proceeded to reinvent Sybase as an ""enabler of the 'unwired enterprise'"".[12] In so doing, Chen and his team led a re-invention strategy that that led to the turnaround of the company into a profitable mobile device producer,[13] valued at $6 billion in 2010.[12]
Sybase achieved strong financial performance and shareholder returns under Chen's leadership‚Äù

Alright fellow retards.

We all dream of having a million indicators on our 6 monitors and trade on all of them, while normies around us, our wifes and their boyfriends look mesmorized at how professionally retarded we are.

But at the end of the day, we just want easy money with minimal effort

This is why you clicked on this potential shitpost, and here you go:

**RAVI is the ultimate indicator to make 3-4 trades a day with almost 100% accuracy of prediction**

I know I know, it sound like a typical WSB post, but let me present you the proof.

RAVI is a weird looking indicators with boring white bars. They move up and down all day without anything interesting happening. But ***sometimes*** they change color. ***Sometimes*** they become red, or green. And when they change color, you go balls deep.

That's right, every time it becomes a certain color, you essentially **YOLO** your entire account.

Results? 2-8% gain on each entry, and very, very rarely you just break even.

Yesterday I was bored af, checking random indicators on an etoro chart. And then I checked RAVI. It looked boring and retarded, but then I checked what it was about.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dhbw6nx8x4h61.png?width=1183&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74c1d35c185299722202959d0b6a92a487c3b774

As you can see on this example, we have mostly useless white bars, and then 4(5) colored bars.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m3yrb4gtx4h61.png?width=1183&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c0bda2b99da84ce2fb576421b76165eafd785d7

When the bars become green, it means you sell. If it becomes red, you buy.

Sometimes the next bar will be the same color, in which case double your position, or just wait if you already YOLO'd.

I checked a few days worth of market, and to my big suprise, RAVI was right 100% of the time, with the worst result being only a 0.2% gain instead of a significant one.

Now, don't go full retard. As soon as your bet confirms, exit when the time is right, or else you almost always will slowly bleed off your gains.

RAVI only fires 2-3 times a day, but on volatile stocks it can yield great 2-8% trades, like in this case.

Do NOT rely on this indicator for ALL stocks, choose carefully which ones are worth your time.

I was reminded of WSB recently when I read a bestof post about someone who made enough money to pay for his dog‚Äôs surgery. WSB, making money? I got a flash back of all the rockets, of how I thought going long on Tesla was dumb, and cried inside when I compared to the stock price today. So I re-joined and promptly lost 2.5k with GME (my fault, got greedy). I regained it in weed plus a little extra, so we‚Äôre good. 



What to do with this fresh money?



I got curious about CureVac today as I read that they *‚Äúannounced initiation of a rolling submission with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for CVnCoV, the company‚Äôs mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate, currently in late-stage clinical testing.‚Äù* I looked into it, here are my notes: 



CureVac (CVAC) is German biotech with 20 years of experience but new on the stock market (IPOed in August 2020, current market cap 21.4bn).



They developed a COVID mRNA vaccine (similar to Pfizer/Biontech and Moderna) but the CureVac can be shipped and stored at fridge temperature, a major logistics advantage compared to the others. It‚Äôs cheaper to store and transport and can also be used in poor countries that don't have the kind of cold storage the other mRNA vaccines need.



The vaccine is currently in phase 3 testing‚Äîa U.K. trial has finished enrolling 15,000 participants, and another global phase 2b/3 study aims to recruit more than 35,000 volunteers. (They already know it works and it‚Äôs safe so far; in Phase 3 they‚Äôre assessing how well it works plus more safety data.)



CureVac is in collaboration with the UK Government (the UK will provide them with scientific data regarding new strains), Bayer (to scale production of its vaccine, 160m doses) and GSK (to produce 100m doses and to jointly develop second generation vaccines).



The European Commission already has an order in for 405 million doses. It gave CureVac ‚Ç¨75 million in funding to develop CVnCoV, adding to around ‚Ç¨300 million provided by the German government.

The UK ordered 50m doses.



CureVac and partners expect to produce up to 300m doses in 2021 and up to 600m in 2022.



Whenever a new variant of the virus emerges, they can make a vaccine ‚Äúupdate‚Äù in a matter of weeks. Furthermore, they're collaborating with GSK to make the second generation of vaccines (i.e. multivalent vaccines that cover multiple mutations of the coronavirus or multiple respiratory viruses). Such vaccines could become available 2022 subject to regulatory approval.



Other developments in the pipeline: rabies vaccine, and a couple of injectable drugs for skin and lung cancers in Phase 1 clinical trials (preliminary tests in humans). 



**Financials**

Being a newly listed company, there‚Äôs not much data to go with. I only found the *Third Quarter and First 9 Months 2020 Financial Results* on their website and didn‚Äôt look further. There‚Äôs probably a German website where you can find past balance sheet information for the company, but my German sucks. So I only go with this one report I found (first link in the list of sources). I nearly failed my accounting exam and probably only passed it because I cried, you better read the report yourself if you know how to read.


Comparison between Q1-Q3 2020 vs the same period in 2019:

Revenue: 43m (2020) vs 11m (2019)

Net loss: -71m vs -64m (despite spending 46m more in R&amp;D in 2020)

Obviously, these are numbers before they start selling the vaccine (assuming it passes Phase 3). Trying to look at the future, I couldn‚Äôt find any info on the vaccine pricing or how much profit they expect to make per dose. But they‚Äôve *‚Äúruled out selling its inoculation at cost, arguing instead for an ‚Äúethical margin‚Äù for shareholders.‚Äù*. Comparatively, *‚ÄúAstraZeneca and J&amp;J have said they would not seek to profit from their vaccines, at least during the pandemic. ‚Äú*



They have ‚Ç¨892 million in cash as of September 30th, 2020 (from the German govt, the deal with GSK, the IPO and the grant/loan from the European Investment Bank). 



Major shareholders include the founder, the German government and one of the founders of SAP.

I got nothing done at work that week and I've had tension in my chest ever since. I'll be bag holding the other 100 shares for the rest of my life before I fucking sell for a penny less than $420.69, but I got my money back out and took a little profit. I had wanted to buy calls on the Monday instead of shares, but I was too fucking dumb to figure out where I can trade US options from Europe. I still don't know. I literally setup a trading account at like 2am the night before to try to catch a seat on the rocket.

Even greater than the little bit of profit and free shares... what I've really gained... is the feeling that if I dedicate myself to this from now on... if I really focus... I too could one day become retarded.

0.0,line54,336.0,"All I read now on ""new WSB"" is about how robinhood stopped the GME squeeze, and they ""robbed"" investors. ""This was going to $1,000, we got robbed!"" is every other damn post.

Now, personally, I don't buy that this is all a big conspiracy, and that all the brokers halted trading to save one hedge fund. As a long time trader (who has witnessed a lot of halts), it seems far more likely that the brokers were at risk of getting fucked, and they protected themselves. But, I won't get into that, because that's not the point of this post.

This is the point:

THE STOCK MARKET ISN'T FAIR. Never has been, never will be. For example:

1) Big money has access to so much information you don't have. They have access to order flows and shit that cost a fortune. They have entire departments and insiders that do nothing but research and investigate. Is that fair?

2) Big money trades on platforms like bloomberg terminals (and similar), and they can literally see more accurate prices and trade quicker than you. Is that fair?

3) Big money has access to advanced algos that you could never dream of accessing, that auto-trade for them. Is that fair?

4) Big money has so much money that they can literally alter the prices of stocks by buying/selling. They can rotate between stocks and ETFs that hold the stocks to remain invested while manipulating pricing. Is that fair?

I could literally write a 500 point list, but my point is clear: the shit ain't fair. It's no secret. As a retail trader, you are a little guppy punk-ass bitch in a big dick shark pool.

*But we all know that.* It's never been about being fair, it's about profiting from the landscape that we are in.

If you buy into GME at $50, and that shit goes to $500 in a matter of days, then you see some sketchy shit happening and think ""wow the hedge funds and market makers are gonna put an end to this shit..."" Then you hold until it crashes back down to $50 and cry ""it's not fair,"" then you're a fucking idiot. I'm sorry, but that's the deal.

We know big money has the power to crash a stock, so if you see it happening, sell. Better yet, sell and switch to shorts, and play both sides. Don't lose all of your money and then claim the market isn't fair. No shit it isn't fair. What's your point? Profit off that unfairness, ya dumb bitch.

The millions of new WSBers all posting about how ""it isn't fair"" and ""we got robbed,"" it's basically like a little bitch crime boss making a deal with the rival big dick crime boss, then crying because the big dick crime boss lied and stole his money. Hey, no shit. Criminals do that. If you're a crime boss, you know the other crime boss is probably fucking lying, so you hedge against his lies and use that shit against him. That's how it works.

And that's how it works here, too. In the criminal world, people lie to you. In the stock market, big money manipulates shit. You can punch the sky, or you can accept that and play the game with those realities in mind.

When I am in a trade, sure, I'm thinking about the fundamentals and future company performance. The news cycle. All the boring shit. But I'm *also* thinking about big money, retail traders, who is involved and how they are involved, and how all they will react to shifts in the stock price. You *have to,* because that's how the market ticks.

You only win by playing by the rules of the game, and the rules of this game are that the market is largely smoke and mirrors, and you'll never have even 1% of the knowledge or power that a typical hedge fund has. Don't fight it into bankruptcy like a fucking dongus. Play the game.

Am I being negative? Nah, I'm being realistic. You want to fight to make the market more free and fair? Go on. Fight to make it better. It's a good thing to do, and I support it. And I'll help you. But in the meantime, accept what the market is *right now.* Don't throw you and your family's money away as a moral martyr, saying ""well i wouldn't have lost all my money if the market was different!"" It's not different. It is what it is.

And if you legitimately can't disconnect yourself from that idealism, then it's probably just best not to trade. For your own sake.","I can't believe I have to say this, but a lot of people need to hear it: THE STOCK MARKET ISN'T FAIR",866.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/line54/i_cant_believe_i_have_to_say_this_but_a_lot_of/

A) Buy high and sell low to ""mitigate"" losses. Fuck these types might sell as soon as they see a 1-3% drop, literally locking in a loss instead of moving away from the screen and averaging down or holding

here's why y'all are sleeping on Cloudflare $NET

Cloudflare ($NET) is a web infrastructure and security company that [has a history of defending free speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudflare#Controversies). They are one of the largest neutral cloud service providers in the U.S. and they innovate a lot in network security and product development.

**Beat earnings by 33%, price dropped 7%**

* Previous quarters they had performed much better, but beating expected EPS by 33% and losing 7% of its share price in a day just makes it a better value right now at $86.

**Price targets above $100 (Currently $86)**

* Many companies are [raising their price targets](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/cloudflare-drops-despite-multiple-price-target-upgrades) anywhere between $90-$105.

**364% annual growth**

* They IPO'd at $15 a share for a $525M market cap, but immediately traded at $18. They have **363% growth in the past year**. There's plenty of growth left, especially if (when?) they strike a deal with a huge customer. They have [lots of new, innovative products](https://www.cloudflare.com/whats-new/) coming out *often*.

**Good for big companies**

* If a social media platform or news outlet needed a neutral cloud provider in 2021, Cloudflare has the infrastructure to support them.

**Good for small companies**

* They are liked by the tech community and offer free security services like [DDoS protection](https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos/), [DNS encryption](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/04/how-to-keep-your-isps-nose-out-of-your-browser-history-with-encrypted-dns/), and [domain name hosting](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/), making it ideal for getting customers early on. Very [ARK](https://ark-invest.com/invest-in-innovation/)\-esque IMO.

**History of defending free speech**

* Although they have cut ties with 8chan and The Daily Stormer from public pressure after violent attacks, Cloudflare has a [history of defending free speech even under scrutiny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudflare#Controversies). They don't practice shadowbanning or act very partisan AFAIK.

Instead of jerking to some porn i did some research on PLTR and want to share my DD with you. This might be a longer text for your love dopamine level so maybe you should grab some your Adderall before.

The following text might you give your eyes aids since English isn‚Äôt my native language. I will try my best.

**Palantir as a Company ‚Äì the beginnings**

PLTR was founded by some people and one of them is Peter Thiel who worked alongside with our holy papa Elon at PayPal. As a payment-service they had concerns about money laundering and founded PLTR to tackle this issue early. The CIA also funded PLTR (they are always funding stuff like this ‚Äì Siri as example). This actually might be the reason why people think that PLTR is a company which aggregates data and do data analysis for the government‚Ä¶.but this is not accurate and not correct at all if you see the big picture. I will explain this point later.

You retard still reading? Nice here some rocket emoji‚Äôs to pump your dopamine and keep you happy. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Let‚Äôs start with the DD

First of all my POV is looking for a midterm to long term investment in PLTR. My valuation considers PLTRs current state and predicting from now on for the next few years.

&amp;#x200B;

* **1. The Management**

Before I start with the product I rather start with the management. You can sell the nicest thing in the world. I can guarantee you that the product definitely won‚Äôt be considered as the nicest thing after a while if you have a shitty management (Intel). With Peter Thiel on the leaderboard we got a competent asshole and CEO is Alex carp (co-founder) Peter Thiel is well known and Alex Karp is one of us. He yolod his heritage into some business and become a chad. Seriously tho, I trust Peter and if Peter holds on Alex since Decades so do I. Peter proved so many times how cunning he is and showed how to pick adapt problems early and create solutions.

&amp;#x200B;

* **2. PLTR Business model/ products**

Before we understand how important PLTRs products are we have to understand that we are simpeltons who don‚Äôt have any business with PLTRs. We create data. We don‚Äôt fuck with it. We creating with using our phones or working in the office. Only a few of us may working with accumulated big data. PLTRs customers‚Äô base isn‚Äôt neighbor Joe or Aunt Nancy. The products they offer are not even for midcap companies they are more designed for whole industries and governments. That‚Äôs the reason why their products aren‚Äôt so tangible for many people.

PLTR basically offers systems to big companies/governments which import their data into these systems. PLTR doesn‚Äôt sends workers to the client to collect data and analyse it. They sell platforms. They got 2 Products called ‚ÄúGotham‚Äù and ‚ÄúFoundry‚Äù You may think wtf is this guy talking about? Let me explain it in 2 examples:

First example is Syria with Gotham. It was impossible in the country to know who the good guys are and who the bad ones are. I know u muricans only know yourself and the rest of the world is the ‚Äúrest of the world‚Äù for you. But this wasn‚Äôt so simple in Syria you had many factions with different intentions and some of them were allies and some of them were enemies. The lack of information or the ability of recognizing and sorting these information‚Äôs are crucial in a war. PLTR solved the struggle with creating a map which provided resilient information for the marines so they can operate safely. Civil problems over there could also be fixed.

[https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/04/palantir-using-big-data-to-solve-big-humanitarian-crises/](https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/04/palantir-using-big-data-to-solve-big-humanitarian-crises/)

Actually what the John Hopkins University does with the covid numbers and the map, is some sort of what PLTR offering with their solutions. There are rumors that the tracking of Covid and the vaccination will be done by PLTR.

In their S1 Form PLTR describes it this way

‚ÄúGotham, our first software platform, was constructed for analysts at defense and intelligence agencies. They were hunting for needles not in one, but in thousands of haystacks. And they did not have the software they needed to do their jobs. In Afghanistan and Iraq, soldiers were mapping networks of insurgents and makers of roadside bombs by hand. Gotham enables users to identify patterns hidden deep within datasets, ranging from signals intelligence sources to reports from confidential informants, and helps U.S. and allied military personnel find what they are looking for.‚Äù

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406\_11](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406_11)

The second example is about ‚ÄúFoundry‚Äù and it‚Äôs directly from the S1 File of PLTR (page 121)

‚ÄúAn Airbus A350, for example, has five million parts and is built by hundreds of teams that are spread across four countries and more than eight factories. Companies routinely struggle to manage let alone make sense of the data involved in large projects. Foundry was built for them. The platform transforms the ways in which organizations interact with information by creating a central operating system for their data.‚Äù

Both of these systems solving big issues with less effort. The arms industry as example would took billions for drones and stuff in Syria for the same job. The important fact is that PLTR does not spend so much resources for new clients they only have to provide access and support for their services and the client feeding the ‚Äúmachine‚Äù with data.

The key point is to understand that PLTR benefits very huge from economy of scales. This is very important since their costs for additional revenue is basically flat while the profits growing exorbitant with new customers. They offer a software and platforms and not kind of services where they need man power. All they do is working on their platforms and improving it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* **3. PLTRs big issue during the last decade**

Peter Thiel was a great supporter of Trump and funded his elections campaign. The market thought that when trump wins then PLTR will get all the government (especially military) contracts.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html)

But this didn‚Äôt happened. Peter got cucked by the huge authority apparatus in pentagon. These dudes loves bureaucracy and they do it for a good reason. If you retire from your job in pentagon you usually get a high paid luxurious position at Lockheed, Raytheon or Bae Systems to make additional free money for your retirement. Many thousand people working in pentagon just to select and buy stuff for the government. They spending billions of dollars for purchases and then PLTR came around and said like ‚Äûlook guys we can do this job for a few millions instead billions‚Äú. Of course the arms industry was pissed and the pentagon boomers helped them out. PLTR got constantly scammed from boomers and didn‚Äôt get the contracts. This was also the ‚Äûswamp ‚Äûtrump was talking about.

A fun fact to this matter: Before James Mattis got summoned as the Defense Secretary of the USA he was a general in Afghanistan. He ordered services from PLTR despite the fact the pentagon was against it. But the marines praised PLTRs software and valued it over the trash they used to know from the defense/arms industry.

Even with a James Mattis as the defense secretary, trump as president and regardless that PLTR does it better and cheaper than the arms industry, it wasn‚Äôt possible for PLTR to get the government contracts.

The lawsuits were perfect uppercut hits on the arms industry and they ended some fraudulent behaviors and ‚Äûbest practices ‚Äûin the government

PLTR will profit from a Biden who wants to decrease the military expenditures. They will get the job done and at the same time the costs will go down. With the recent judgements the door looks open.

&amp;#x200B;

* **4. Valuation problems**

I could spam some multiplication on revenue or even a DCF but I think it‚Äôs not necessary. Expect the costs of research and development (maybe marketing) the costs of PLTR stood mostly flat in the last quarters. It‚Äôs a growth stock and the pricing is mostly in the perspective of PLTR. This is actually all we need to know that the revenue increases while the costs staying mostly flat. Check out the balance sheets at page 12 on the S Form 1.

Let‚Äôs talk about the market. The whole market seems overpriced but it isn‚Äôt tbh. Due to the low cost of capital there is no alternative than to throwing your money on stocks or on real estate. There is nothing with a solid interest rate around (not even in emerging markets). At the stock exchange like in 70s, the companies had to offer a return, a perspective which should be more attractive as putting your money on a saving account with 8% interests without risks. These times are gone since the 2000s. So before people discuss insane valuation they should check out the fiscal and economical policies.

Now back to PLTR and why the price is difficult to set (cheap imo). First of all PLTR did a direct listing without an investment bank for their share offerings. Its lacking of the valuation which they usually would get through such a process.

PLTR wanted to do IPO with Morgan Stanley but it was mess.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/morgan-stanley-s-long-romance-of-palantir-pays-off-as-ipo-nears](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/morgan-stanley-s-long-romance-of-palantir-pays-off-as-ipo-nears)

Morgan Stanley proved themselves many times as stubborn communists when it comes to valuations. I mean you guys remember their disgusting price targets for tesla like 100$ post split or stuff like that.

These guys are very focused on numbers and I know it‚Äôs difficult to price in the potential and perspectives. But you can‚Äôt ignore these things for a fundamental valuation. If you want to consider these things in the price you have to understand the business of the company.

This ended that one team at Morgan Stanley valuated PLTR with 5 billion while another team thought they worth 40 billion.

[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/14/palantir-ipo-valuation-morgan-stanley.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/14/palantir-ipo-valuation-morgan-stanley.html)

How is this difference possible and why is this happening? Because people don‚Äôt understand what they are valuating. This happened a lot in the last decade because the decision makers in these banks and many analyst don‚Äôt have any idea which metrics they should use on companies like that. They are using the metrics from classical industries on new business. They freaked out when Facebook was valued with 100 billion as IPO. Same with Twitter and in the last years it was Tesla. They said apple going to tank every damn year in the last decade. I honor Warren Buffet so much since he has the dignity to realize that he don‚Äôt understands something but at the same time he sees the potential and the trend. That‚Äôs why he hired 2 Chads who bought Snowflake for him. The transformation and the generation change didn‚Äôt happened yet. That‚Äôs why they try to use the metrics from Caterpillar on Tesla.

Guys the whole market is mooning with the cheap liquidity. Pennystocks and zombie companies transforming into billion dollar market cap companies. Facebook as IPO had a market cap of 104 billion back in 2012. At that time it wasn‚Äôt possible for Facebook to monetize their users with selling ads. They just paid 100 billion for the potential in more difficult market conditions.

Look at the IPOs like doordash, Bumble. I‚Äôm not going to call this a bubble. Just check out their business cases and use the metrics. Maybe its easier for people to understand Bumble and Doordash‚Ä¶

On page 12 of the S1 (balance sheet) Form you can already see the huge positive trends in PLTRs revenue and their costs. All this without all the positive events and contracts PLTR recently got.

PLTRs valuation is difficult and I think it‚Äôs miscalculated by pessimistic communist who don‚Äôt understand that their products are game changers for industries, governments and defense forces. Because of these points I think there is huge price potential for PLTR

&amp;#x200B;

* **5. Risks for PLTR**

Despite the general market risks PLTR mentions at page 29 of the S1 Form the competitors as the main risk: ‚ÄúWe face intense competition in our markets, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.‚Äù The S1 Form didn‚Äôt aged well. Actually I don‚Äôt think that PLTR would have any trouble with offering new shares. Also with Peter Thiel as one of the founders the financial side should be stable.

As PLTR competitor people use to mention IBM. The boomers from IBM already surrendered with their Windows95 computers and decided to cooperate. The biggest threat would be big tech with big money like AMZN or APPL. You all now the stories about APPL and Spotify or AMZN and all the merchants. Even if the big players would step into PLTR markets it would be difficult for them since PLTRs products doesn‚Äôt rely on an Amazon store or on apple devices. PLTR is years ahead with their products.

I think the greatest risk (still) are the boomerish arms industry and all the boomers in pentagon and other authorities.

There are very corrupt infrastructures when it comes to decision making and assigning contracts. People fear changes but they can‚Äôt avoid the changes. With the recent judgements we can see a turn on the tables but the transformation will still take time. It‚Äôs a circuit breaker with an avalanche effect.

The risk factors on page 16 on the S1 form mostly aren‚Äôt relevant anymore. People complained that PLTR wasn‚Äôt profitable for 18 years. Well PLTR was never designed to be profitable and Alex Karp once said ‚Äúlove us or leave us alone‚Äù.

[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/09/09/palantir-ceo-makes-livestreamed-pitch-to-investors.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/09/09/palantir-ceo-makes-livestreamed-pitch-to-investors.html)

But even this changed recently. PLTR became profitable in 2020 with 130,000,000¬ß. Now the same people complaining about how high the stock price compared to the profits. Well just you wait.

&amp;#x200B;

* **6. Conclusion and Outlook**

If you still reading I have to admit that this was a lot text and i am sorry again about the lingo. Let‚Äôs connect the dots and bring this information to a point

1. The boomer coalition in the pentagon and in the arms industry is taken down by PLTR. They will able to get the governments contracts and the classic arms/defense industry is no match for PLTR products. The judgements of lawsuits were catalyst and the effects should be already shown in the next earnings. These were such underrated events but I think there still will be some odds but PLTRs situation is much better as it was a time ago. The chains are off!
2. Military expenditures rising worldwide

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qqcv8vzee4h61.jpg?width=744&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98d264f091b7ff80926038660f43c57b87fc8ef2

[https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion)

With Bidens presidency we will see more disruptive technologies chosen by the government. Biden want to reduce the military expenditures. PLTR is able to provide better service for lower cost. Not only the recent judgements also the political change will help PLTR. Ironic if you remember that Peter supported Trump and getting his tendies from Biden.

3. PLTR superior products profits hugely from economy of scales. They don‚Äôt have any significant costs when they acquire new customers. Making the big data usable for decisions making is already very important and step by step people realize that this issue growing fast. We creating everyday more data than we did yesterday and leaving the majority of it as trace and unstructured data. We don‚Äôt work with it but big Institutions does.

Here is the passage from the S1 and I fully agree with it:

‚ÄúThe systemic failures of government institutions to provide for the public ‚Äî fractured healthcare systems, erosions of data privacy, strained criminal justice systems, and outmoded ways of fighting wars ‚Äî will continue to require both the public and private sectors to transform themselves. We believe that the underperformance and loss of legitimacy of many of these institutions will only increase the speed with which they are required to change.‚Äù

4. PLTRs value. The current situation of the market with tons of liquidity seems like a bubble. People don‚Äôt know what to do with the cheap capital and people throwing it even on meme pennystocks.

Facebook had his ipo back in 2012 during much harder market conditions as now. The valuation of Facebook was over 100 billion and people called it insanely overvalued. They did it because Facebook didn‚Äôt had a way to monetize their users (especially on mobile platforms). Facebook has a market cap of over 750 billion now and nobody calling it over valued.

A remember the recent examples? Bumble?! Bruuuh. Don‚Äôt get me wrong if you invested in Bumble but they have nothing special to offer and their business case can easily copied or improved by others. Its shows the current state of our market with the crazy liquidity that even zombie companies got astronomic valuations. Use these metrics on PLTR with great products, great management, low cost base and less odds as ever before‚Ä¶.

PLTR price is wrong imo especially in this market and with PLTRs current state and perspective.

5. Do you use PLTR? Me Neither! It‚Äôs not designed for us and we have to inform us about the success. PLTRs new contracts and their future are shining bright. With the settled lawsuits the sky is clear for PLTR. But their customer base is not only America. I‚Äôm not a murican and 3 weeks before I just find out that the police departments in our state using PLTR products. I don‚Äôt need to link endless evidences here since you can google it by yourself and see how many contracts PLTR recently got. Especially after the circuit breakers we talked about.

I have genuinely trust into Peter Thiel and Alex Karp that their will make the best of PLTRs potential. The odds getting removed and the demand for PLTR is increasing.

If all these information would priced in correctly we would have a share price of at least 60-70$.  With upcoming and ongoing positive events PLTR share price should soar more..

**What‚Äôs next?**

Now we have earnings ahead and the lock up period ending.

For the earnings I think the number will be fine and keep up the positive trend on revenue with a disproportionately trend of the costs. The most important part will be guidance for 2021. We should listen closely and see if the magic is already happening.

The second event is the ending of the lock up period. You all remember the end of the lock up period of Nikola? Just 1-2 days after they announced they don‚Äôt got the GM deal? The stock tanked ‚Äì for a good reason. You know the guy Trevor Milton.

But in PLTRs case everything is different. Despite the successful deals they got, does a guy who says ‚Äúlove us or leave us alone‚Äù sounds like someone who going to drop his shares at the first possibility? I don‚Äôt expect such a behavior from Alex Karp and neither from Peter Thiel. If some employees drop their shares it should be fine.

I would appreciate if the stock prices would go below 3√ü. It would create a healthy bullish chart pattern and would be actually a nice discount to get in or stock up. I don‚Äôt think that the shares going to dump a lot because of this event. The earnings and the guidance are more important and the key events if you want to invest mid ‚Äì long term.

What does all this means for you? Nothing! Please don‚Äôt do any market activity based on my DD. I‚Äôm just sharing my knowledge and looking for critics so I can reevaluate my theses. This is not a financial advice.

My hearts bleeding for all the GME holders. My last Reddit account got banned because I criticized ‚Äúthe pumpers‚Äù. In one of the comments I called the mods gay and got banned permanently (bye bye 20 k karma). If you are new to this please don‚Äôt do any decision based on this so I can sleep gladly.

I‚Äôm not well positioned and not trying to pump this stock. I have 70 shares and a CSP. Fair play and fuck all the bots and pump and dumper we recently got in the sub!

I'm here to tell you why I think Continental Automotive (CTTAY) is a great play for the EV sector.

1. **What does Continental do?** Most people think of Continental Tires when they hear the name, however, Continental does way more than that. According to their 2019 investor presentation, Rubber only accounts for 40 percent of their sales. They are the number 3 automotive parts supplier globally. Continental has also acquired many tech companies over the past few years to prepare for the EV boom. They have acquired cybersecurity companies, AI software companies, and LIDAR and antenna companies. Not to mention their partnership with NVIDIA for computing power. Overall, just a great spread of technology.
2. **Covid recovery:** Continental was hit hard by Covid just like the rest of the automotive sector. Their stock pre-Covid was around $12 dollars, with it sitting around $30 2-3 years ago. The current stock price has been hovering around $14, so it recovered nicely however not nearly as much as the rest of the automotive sector has rebounded. Major players like F, HMC, GM, TSLA, TM, and others have all far surpassed their pre-Covid highs.
3. **EV, Autonomous Driving, and 5G:** Continental has their foot in the door with almost every major vehicle manufacturer, and most manufacturers are slowly converting to EVs. They also currently have a partnership with a Chinese EV company for an electric drive train. That being said, 5G is the most interesting thing that Continental has going for it in my opinion. They are developing a 5G network access device (their previous version of this is in a majority of cars on the road). This will allow quick access to the internet for vehicles on the road.
4. **V2X:** V2X is Vehicle to X communication. This includes vehicles communicating with other vehicles on the road, which many deem necessary for fully autonomous driving. This also includes vehicle to traffic signal communication, as well as anything else a vehicle may need to communicate with, hence V2*X*. This is something I see lacking in other EV companies like Tesla, (Musk is too stubborn to admit that V2X technology will be needed to actually have autonomous driving) Continentals 5G chips will enable their V2X software to be on as many cars as they want. (Also I'm not discrediting Tesla, I've heard that gets you downvotes on this sub. Please spare me Musk daddy and Grimes mommy)

Anyway, these are just a couple of things I found while reading through their Q3 2020 Financial report as well as their 2019 plans for the future. (linked below)

Like I said I don't really know what I'm doing, (especially with like earnings and valuations) but when I read through their literature (JK I CANT READ) it seems like a lot of really interesting tech and I believe the company is currently undervalued. Totally willing to be proven wrong by some dumb ass apes tho

The tits pattern is shaping up nicely.

Using nerds lingo, it could be a double cup and handle and not just a double bottom as previously suggested.

For the pattern to be confirmed, we shouldn't have any drops below $49. A strong rejection around $57 would form the handle.

- Tops and bottoms

Yeah they give us false hopes and show us the mid 50s just to push us back down on low volume duh.

But guys, we're making higher lows. That's big.

They were able to push as low as $46 (first tit in the tits pattern), then as low as $48 (2nd tit bottom), then $49 for a brief moment during power hour.

Making higher lows and claiming $49 as the new support would be massive. That's our short term goal.

Why? Because $44-$49 had been a massive resistance zone from July 2014 until November 2015. Then it dropped to oblivion.

- History repeating itself

It looks like we're losing, but we're not.

When GME was in the $10-$13 limbo in early November, the price action was eerily similar: pushed down intraday - even after strong bullish moves at open - because of the low volume.

Hopes crushed every day. But little did we know that we were making higher lows and a double cup and handle. Very similar to what's happening right now.

What caught my attention was the very interesting move they pulled when their stock exploded. They dumped 91 million fresh shares into the market, blunting the still massive surge in stock price and capturing a huge windfall in the process. Now they're sitting on over $180 million dollars in cash to fund R&amp;D and diversify with.

To me this looks like they are positioned to diversify their products and expand well out of their initial niche, unless they pocket it all in the form of bonus checks and run. It makes me think that we're just waiting for them to announce that they're working on a new a product in a bigger market and they'll go nuts again.

If anyone in your house has Boomer cable news, then the commercial jingle would be familiar to you. (Oh-oh-oh-Ozempic-oh-oh). It's a diabetes drug that's about to explode in value later this year.


For anyone who doesn't know how drug regulation works, clinical trials are needed before the FDA will approve a drug as being safe and effective for a given indication. 


Currently Ozempic has been approved for diabetes only. Their current commercials mention that you ""may"" lose weight on the drug. They can't advertise that you ""will definitely lose weight"", because the FDA hasn't approved it for that specific indication... yet.


On Wednesday Novo Nordisk released information that their post marketing clinical trial of Ozempic proved that it could help you achieve weight loss at an average rate of around 15kg (~30 pounds) per year without a change in diet or lifestyle. Once they submit this data to the FDA, Novo will have the world's first ""thin pill"", and they can start marketing it to young women instead of just diabetic Boomers.


Of course the catch is that if you stop taking it, the weight comes back, so you have to be a customer for life... or change your lifestyle.


When the news came out on Wednesday the stock jumped $2 immediately and has been rising since. I watched it for a day thinking it might decline, but no such luck, it's going steadily up. It's a Boomer stock so low risk/low reward for now, but if this drug can be approved this year (looking likely), then it'll be great for their earnings. I think it'll be the next Viagra.

Disclosure: this was all taken and edited from u/krush0910 who wrote an extensive dd and you retards missed it - also I‚Äôm not an investment advisor 

Realtors have always been the vehicle of connecting buyers and sellers to one another in the process of buying or selling a home. They hold the coveted keys to the castle. The Association of Realtors has done an excellent job of protecting the industry over the past 2 decades, but technology is getting to the point where they won‚Äôt be able to continue to do this in the way they have in the past.

Only Realtors have access to MLS, however  MLS shares that data with online listing websites like Zillow and Realtor.com. Those websites then attract buyers in the market looking at property, they capture the data and then sell the data to the Realtors as leads.

Every property listed on the MLS is usually listed with a Supra iBox that houses the keys for the house for showings. Only Realtors are allowed to hold the keys to these Supra boxes and everytime they are opened, that data is captured and stored. Opendoor has created their own system for lockboxes and showings. They have their own lockboxes. And anyone can download the app to their phone and access the Opendoor properties. Without a Realtor.

In most situations, sellers list their home while they are still living in the property. They have to because until recently, there were only retail buyers who bought them and sellers needed the proceeds from their sale to buy their next house. Sellers listed their house and dealt with the headaches of showings and repairs, negotiations and strict timelines for closings. Sellers went to closing in a moving truck and so did buyers. Everything relied on perfect timing for everything to happen. Lots of drama and massive potential for any one thing to go wrong that sends the entire house of cards tumbling. Delayed lender, appraisal, yada yada yada.

Enter Opendoor. A company that pulls the power of the transaction away from the coveted few, and puts it right into the consumers‚Äô hands. On both the buyer and seller sides. You see, they have the capital to do this. They have the money to purchase the house without the headache of the buyer‚Äôs side and their drama. Seller calls the shots on when closing happens. Seller doesn‚Äôt have to deal with showings, fixing up their house or repair negotiations, buyer‚Äôs demands, doesn‚Äôt have to rely on the buyer‚Äôs lender‚Äôs drama, have to deal with realtors, or even pay commission. (Oftentimes 6%) Opendoor makes it easy.

Money is merely a measurement of stored time and energy. People underestimate how valuable that is.  Opendoor provides value in saving both for the seller. They eliminate the stress and uncertainly of the unknown.

Opendoor owns the house after closing. They then ready the property to list for sale. They have entire departments devoted to this and marketers on staff who understand exactly what sells a house the quickest. They optimize the house with the knowledge they have.
Then they list it. Except they don‚Äôt use one of those mysterious Supra boxes to house the keys to the house that only Realtors have access to. They use their own lockboxes. And they give the power of the showings to the consumer (Buyer) directly. No agent required. The buyer can download their app and access any of their properties, on their schedule.

When buyer is ready to make an offer, they can fill it out directly on the Opendoor website. The form is so easy to understand that a child could navigate it. The form fills in the contract and meets the specific legal requirements for each state. In the past, this was where Realtors could be valuable. The contracts were so hard to understand, the regular consumer couldn‚Äôt manage them without help. Opendoor makes it possible to.  Kinda like Turbo Tax with taxes. Similar in that regard.

Additionally, Opendoor offers the buyers discounts for making offers to them directly.

Opendoor: ‚ÄúIf you buy with Opendoor and finance with Opendoor Home loans (ODHL), you can save up to 1% of your home price via a combination of an ODHL lender credit and either a seller credit at closing (If buying directly) or a commission refund (If working with an Opendoor agent). Amounts vary.‚Äù

And yes, Opendoor has their own in-house mortgage company to finance your home as well.

Opendoor: ‚ÄúFinance with Opendoor Home Loans and get up to $1,000 credit at closing‚Äù

In a few years, legislation will catch up and it will start allowing eNotary services on closing documents. Covid is the vehicle for pushing this through. Notes, Deed of Trusts, even deeds will legally be signed electronically. Eventually, even the closing will be able to happen all online. Opendoor says they will handle this part through their app too.

The real estate iBuying ecommerce market is going to EXPLODE with Millennials and Zoomers and even some Gen X coming into the market. As a Millennial myself, I don‚Äôt like or want to deal with other people. We grew up behind the screen and we simple don‚Äôt know or understand the social skills it takes to communicate face to face. Not only that, we don‚Äôt want to. It‚Äôs a waste of time. We want to control everything and we want instant gratification.

Currently Opendoor is only active in 20 markets in the US. They plan to scale to 100 markets within a year. In the Charlotte market I work in, I have seen the closing attorney who handles the Opendoor closings scale from 1 employee to over 100 employees within 2 years.

**Comment from an Opendoor employee on the original post:** /u/casrox

I have some insight. Former employee. Basically the way opendoor works is by buying houses for less than market price and creating a floating inventory of product(houses) they they actual place in a holding subsidiary. Some of these houses are in hot markets so flip relatively easily, some are in colder markets so the price will be lower and it will take longer to sell. All these factors + condition of house and title issues come into play when they buy a house or sell a house at a certain price. They use a proprietary algorithm so don't know all the specifics as I wasn't a programmer and never messed with that. They make their money from a combination of closing fees, title work fees and profit off their house flipping. A seller/buyer can also bring their own realtor in, but will end up paying both opendoor fee and realtor fee. A lot of times they are able to make pretty decent profit on hot market houses that cover the losses they might suffer on a property they are having a hard time selling or that ends up being a complete wash due to unforseen circumstances(a house that had a murder happen in it and company was never informed for instance). They have well informed title teams with full curative and escrow staff in house due to their acquisition of title company named osnational. They were doing so much prior to acquisition that osnational created subsidiary companies that's exclusively worked on title and closings for opendoor. Due to this they are able to complete title work extremely fast and in some cases 24-48hr closings were not out of the question. They make money in other ways as well, such as doing outside contract title work for other companies and having a mortgage company built into business(opendoor mortgage) to increase the number of fingers they have in the proverbial pie. I never saw the numbers, as I was just a cog in the machine, but I can tell you the output/transactions increased month over month for many months prior to my leaving. The only real risk they run is of housing market does cool and they are stuck with too much inventory(just like of car market cooled and carving had too many cars and no buyers). With interest rates low tho they also get a steady income stream from refinances so not sure how big of a hit they would take if the cool off only lasted a couple months. I still do same job, just for another company, and will say the whole housing industry(buying/selling transactions) is booming. So much so that at the company I work for now, we are understaffed and 60hr+ weeks are not uncommon in order to keep up with massive volume. Opendoor flips primarily low-mid price range houses - which I assume is because it lowers the risk in case cool off period happens. The place I currently work does real high end boutique place(1.5mil-3mil is average price range) and we are slammed so I can assume pretty easily that opendoor is even more slammed. Finally, opendoor is also increasing to more and more markets. Since I left they have expanded to a handful of markets I know about and I'm sure others that they haven't disclosed publicly yet. Anyway, thanks for coming to my Ted talk.

**CONCERNS:**

**WHAT ABOUT THE CRASH COMING WE ARE IN A BUBBLE**

As someone who was in the industry during the recovery during the 2008 crash and who helped people avoid foreclosure firsthand, I can explain to you how what we see happening now is NOTHING like what we saw happen then.

The catalyst for the 2008 crash was the teaser ARM (Adjustable rate mortgage) rates that people were given for their mortgages. These rates fluctuated as such a volatile rate, that homeowners found themselves in situations where they could not pay their mortgage within a few years of buying. They did not understand the implications of the ARM loans when they signed on at a teaser, discounted interest rate and did not realize how drastically their mortgage payments would change once those rates adjusted.

The majority of home owners now are at a 2-5% FIXED, 30 year interest rate. Their mortgage payments are about 50% less than what the going rental rate is (at least in my market). People are literally saving thousands of dollars by owning their homes vs. renting. It‚Äôs cheaper.

Additionally, the 2008 crash happened because people were able to get mortgages by stating their income. There was no underwriting process that verified anything. They called them NINJA loans- No Income, No Job, No Assets. This simply can't happen anymore at any point after the 08 crash. Lenders verify income, debt and credit 3 times during underwriting now, even the day of closing. 

**WHAT ABOUT THE PANDEMIC AND IMPENDING CLOSURES**

As someone who works in this industry, I am seeing firsthand that every lender is pushing the unpaid mortgage payments on the backend of the notes. This will allow people to avoid paying large lump sums up front.

Additionally, NO ONE IS UNDERWATER in their houses right now. So if, for some reason, a lender were to demand payment, the seller could simply sell and walk away. I haven‚Äôt seen a single lender do this. Not one.

**Comment: If I knew I was selling my property for less then fair market value, potentially tens of thousands of dollars, I‚Äôd suck it up and hire an agent.**

Everyone has their different requirements, desires and wants. Many have different ones. Grandma afraid of Covid and doesn't want showings? No Problemo! No Realtor interview process or dealing with them in the house either? Yes please! Closing happens on my watch at my desired time without crazy buyers in a moving truck barking up my ass? Sign me up! I control the entire transaction myself without relying on a Realtor to do it for me? Sold.

Some people don't care about a few thousand bucks if they know that the time, energy and stress was less. Those things have value too.

People don't realize that Money is merely a storage of value for work/time/energy.

Retail buyers require 10x the headache and energy. You may end up making $2k more on paper, but you've lost it all (and more) by the end of the transaction with the time and energy you had to spend to get there.

**ISN‚ÄôT THIS JUST UBER FOR HOUSES**

Opendoor actually holds tangible assets unlike companies other than just their software like DoorDash, Uber, etc... 

Sidenote: I would wager that it's VERY likely that they eventually create a property management interface on their app that connects landlords with tenants for a fee and handles the Property Management side of things. This is an obvious next play. I can't confirm this, but it's just what I would be implementing of this were my company.

Once again after a change of management. All stores in operations still, it declared chapter 15 bankruptcy and took the stock price from 14 to 5 just because the word bankruptcy scared people without most knowing the difference with a chapter 15 and chapter 7 or 11.

If they still have cash on hand and all stores running and a few months back the company stated half the stores are profitable, shouldn‚Äôt it be way higher then IPO price from 2 years ago?

I bought 1 GME at 50$, and I'm holding. I also wanted to ask about GME business debt of 219$ million. I saw a report that Gamestop didn't file their (notice of earnings)? to their shareholders, so GME couldn't sell their shares of the company to pay off their own debts, which they probably could have because they filed to sell off $100 million of their shares with IRS.

So, if we hold long enough, and do xyz. could we profit, and GME pay their debts off at some point this year? Or, is that a shot in the dark because we don't know what GME plans to do?

I believe GameStop is going to use the momentum behind the short squeeze interest to launch a digital currency. Please take a look at their website, specifically their ""rewards center"" area: [https://www.gamestop.com/poweruprewards/rewards-center/](https://www.gamestop.com/poweruprewards/rewards-center/)

Here's a pic of the exact part I'm interested in:

The GameStop execs aren't stupid, they understand that this is their second chance to make their company wildly successful. It appears that they are planning on offering rewards in either a token of their own design, or some other digital currency.

**Technical Analysis:**

Lets take a look at the 3 month history of this stock. It ran up from 2-&gt;9 back in December, then quickly dropped back to $5. Now, history is repeating itself as we pop from 7-&gt;19, and I expect it to retrace back to the $10 range.

And if we learned anything from these sky-rocketing stocks (eg, weed stocks) - what comes up fast, comes down fast.
